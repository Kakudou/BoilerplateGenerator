Feature: A Constraint should'nt be create if another one exist with the same name.

    Scenario: Create a Constraint who already exist to check the error.
        Given I have a <constraint> already created.
        When I try to create another <constraint> with the same <constraint_name>.
        Then I have an error telling me <constraint_name> already exist.
