Constraint: A Feature should'nt be create if another one exist with the same name.

    Scenario: Create a Feature who already exist to check the error.
        Given I have a <feature> already created.
        When I try to create another <feature> with the same <feature_name>.
        Then I have an error telling me <feature_name> already exist.
